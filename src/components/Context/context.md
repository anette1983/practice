Context lets a component provide some information to the entire tree below it.
To pass context:
Create and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue).
Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep.
Wrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent.
Context passes through any components in the middle.
Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings”.
Before you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children.
