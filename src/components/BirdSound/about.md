you are working on a website that allows visitors to play bird sound by pressing
buttons. The user interface is set up so that when a user presses a button it
will start playing the bird sounds. Alternatively, if the bird sound is already
playing, clicking on the button will pause it. Upon a subsequent click on the
button, the sound should continue to play from where it was paused.

Additionally, you need to add multiple buttons for multiple bird sound mp3
tracks.
